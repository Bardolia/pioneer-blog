        <div class="note">
          <p>This day and age, predictability and reliability are two of the most important words when it comes deployments. In this series, I am going to talk about how to add both predictability and reliability to your ASP.NET Core Continuous Integration pipeline using TeamCity and Octopus Deploy.</p>

        <p>We sure came a long way since <a href="deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy-part-1">part 1</a> of this series. Since we started we mnage to accomplish...</p>

        <h2>Database Migrations</h2>
        <h2>Front-end Builds</h2>
        <p>In this series, we focused on building and publishing our ASP.NET Core application inside TeamCity.  But that story is incomplete when talking about most modern web applications. In most cases, there are steps needed to get your front-end assets in a deployable state.  For example, with <a href="/">Pioneer Code</a> I have to transpile my TypeScript, build my Sass and bundle and minify it all together in a nice small package. </p>
        <p>Modern tooling for front-end builds, regardless of the steps you take, are more often then not command line driven. That being said, we can utilize the Command Line Runner Type inside of TeamCity and the necessary steps needed to our Build Steps.</p>
        <p>Depending on your needs you will have series a steps that look like this.</p>

        </a>
        <p>As you can see, there is really nothing going on special here.  I am running native commands against a cli to step through my build process.  Currently my front-end builds steps are made up of the following.</p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <h2>Build Status On GitHub</h2>
        <p>TeamCity now ships with a Build Feature called Commit Status Publisher. This Build Feature allows TeamCity to automatically attach builds statues to a  external system such as GitHub. To get start, head to the Build Features section of your project and select the Select the "Add Build Feature" option.</p>
        <a href="/images/deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy/team-build-1.png" title="TeamCity Build Status" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy/team-build-1.png" alt="TeamCity Build Status" style="max-width: 191px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" />
        </a>
        <p>Here you will be given an option of to select the external system you want to tie into.  Obviously we will be selecting GitHub for our integration. Leave the GitHub URL as is, unless you are hooking up to an on-premise deployment of GitHub Enterprise.</p>
        <p>You can authenticate with GitHub with your username and password, or by creating a personal access token. I opted to use a token so I don't have to worry about remember to update my password in TeamCity every time I change it. </p>
        <a href="/images/deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy/team-build-2.png" title="TeamCity Build Status Setup" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy/team-build-2.png" alt="TeamCity Build Status Setup" style="max-width: 787px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" />
        </a>
        <p>Once you have your Build Feature configured and you have tested your connection, hit save and your Build Feature will be displayed as follows.</p>
        <a href="/images/deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy/team-build-3.png" title="TeamCity Build Status Success" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy/team-build-3.png" alt="TeamCity Build Status Success" style="max-width: 1323px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" />
        </a>
        <p>That's it.  The next time you fire off a build from TeamCity, you will see build status indications inside of GitHub like the following.</p>
        <a href="/images/deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy/team-build-4.png" title="TeamCity Build Status Indicator" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/deploying-asp-net-core-teamcity-and-octopus-deploy/team-build-4.png" alt="TeamCity Build Status Indicator" style="max-width: 950px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" />
