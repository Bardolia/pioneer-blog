        <p>With .NET Core, we get a lot of stuff for free.  If you so choose, wiring up your applications (ASP.NET or Console) with things like Dependency Injection, Configuration and Logging is as simple as can be.  .NET Core bakes these features into the framework and usage of does not require a trade off of power and flexibility. </p>
        <p>Following, I will walk you through getting up and running with all three of these items in a .NET Core console application.</p>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>.NET Core is all about opting into dependencies as opposed to opting out.  That being said we will need to pull in a few nuget packages to facilitate our needs. Open up your app.settings file and insure you have the following. Versions might differ depending on what version of .NET Core you are using.</p>
